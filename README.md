## Overview
An **AI-powered traffic signal simulation system** that dynamically optimizes traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic density while prioritizing emergency vehicle movement. This project reduces congestion, enhances traffic flow efficiency, and tracks fuel and CO₂ savings using a simulated environment.

## 🎯 Features
- **Emergency Vehicle Prioritization:** Detects and prioritizes ambulances/fire trucks to clear their path safely.
- **Dynamic Signal Timing:** Adjusts signal durations based on predicted traffic density using machine learning.
- **Emission & Fuel Tracking:** Monitors fuel consumption and CO₂ reduction during optimization.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Visualizes traffic movement and signal changes using **Pygame**.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses **Matplotlib** to display traffic density and optimization effectiveness.
- **Multithreaded Execution:** Concurrently handles sensor simulation and signal updates for real-time responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** for core logic and ML models
- **Pygame** for traffic simulation and visualization
- **Matplotlib** for data analysis and plots
- **Multithreading** for real-time execution
